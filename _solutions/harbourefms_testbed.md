concept: Allow for adjustment of effect and energy consumption when energy prices are low, or power grid suffers from high load. Remote operations manage chargers, reduce power spikes from high energy demand when docked, improving decarbonising potential. Integration between Virtual Power Server and charging point to include ferries and port facilities are part of the energy market ecosystem for buying, selling and auctioning load capacity.
